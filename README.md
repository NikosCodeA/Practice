# Practice
This is a test repository to exercise the workflow   
Basic git commands:  
git init (initialize, that is create the .git in the local directory)   
    add . (add all the files contained in the local directory )  
    log --graph (display a story of commits with a small graph)  
    diff --cached (show the differences between the files before using the add command )  
    commit (create a time stamp of the files at the state it were after the add)  
git clone http..(it makes  a copy of a remote file )  
git remote add origin http... (Like a shortcut in order to operate commands as it was reffered   
                               to a local folder )
